# Internship_Project_APB_Interfaced_SPI_Master_core

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my RTL design internship at Maven Silicon. The entire SPI Master IP core was built strictly according to detailed architecture diagrams provided by Maven Silicon, which specified every signal, connection, and interface for each block. My role was to translate these diagrams into synthesizable RTL code, ensuring that every module and signal matched the given specifications exactly.

## Design Approach and Key Takeaways

- **Architecture-Driven Implementation:**  
  Every module and signal was coded strictly according to Maven Siliconâ€™s detailed architecture diagrams, ensuring full alignment with industry standards.

- **Signal-Level Precision:**  
  All signal names, widths, and connections were directly mapped from the provided specs, resulting in a clear and robust design.

- **Practical Protocol Experience:**  
  This project offered hands-on RTL coding and deepened my understanding of SPI protocol and real-world hardware design practices.

## Summary

By building the SPI Master IP core exactly as specified in the provided architecture diagrams, I developed both my technical skills and my appreciation for the importance of detailed, signal-level design in digital systems. This experience has prepared me for future work in protocol-based hardware design and SoC integration, where architectural clarity and implementation discipline are essential.
